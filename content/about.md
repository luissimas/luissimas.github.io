## Professional experience

### Software engineer, QuintoAndar (2025-Present)

I'm currently working in the fintech area of QuintoAndar. My work today is mostly composed of building back-end systems using Kotlin, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Kafka and AWS.

### Cloud developer, Luizalabs (Magalu Cloud) (2024-2025)

At Magalu Cloud, I've worked on foundation systems and infrastructure that power the cloud platform. During my time here, I've:

- Designed and implemented processes for test, validation, and release via CI/CD pipelines
- Developed automation solutions for deploying and operating critical infrastructure services
- Contributed new features and bug fixes to open source projects such as Incus and Juju. Most notability, I've co-authored the [implementation](https://github.com/lxc/incus/pull/1621) of the [LINSTOR storage driver](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/storage_linstor)

### Software developer freelancer, Upwork (2023-2024)

I've worked as a freelancer for some time because I wanted to experience direct contact with the end customer. I've delivered several end-to-end solutions, some of them are:

- Migrated production MongoDB database with 20+ GiB of data
- Designed and implemented serverless cloud architectures in GCP
- Created automations via CLIs in Node.js

### Back-end developer, Liven Tech (2022-2024)

Liven is a software house in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil. Their clients range from startups to big companies in a variety of domains.

As a back-end developer at Liven, I had the chance to work on a fast-paced environment composed of small squads dealing with constant change in project requirements. A good portion of my work was focused on the development of **REST APIs** in Node.js using Typescript and Clean Architecture. Besides that, I also worked on developing and operating **telecom platforms** in both Python and Node.js.

During my period with telecom platforms, I worked in instrumenting the applications with Prometheus and Grafana. Besides that, I also developed a process for load testing applications using open source tools such as [xk6-diameter](https://github.com/MATRIXXSoftware/xk6-diameter). The load tests provided us valuable insights to identify and solve bottlenecks that ultimately led to an almost 100X performance improvement in our Python services.

Finally, the work environment enabled me to start a **functional programming study group** with my coworkers. Together, we developed an internal tool using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView that was widely used in the company.

### Software developer, CATI Jr (2021-2023)

In the beginning of my graduation I've joined a **junior enterprise** focused on building software solutions for local businesses called CATI Jr. The bulk of my work consisted in the development of **REST APIs in Node.js**, which introduced me to project management, patterns, documentation and **Scum practices**. During my time at CATI Jr, I worked on:

- Developing REST APIs with Node.js
- Integrating with payment services such as Mercado Pago
- Helped in designing an internal process for knowledge retention within the company

# Education

### Researcher (Volunteer), Distributed Systems Group (UFSCar) (2024-2025)

This research group is focused in researching and developing software that plays a key role in the foundation of public clouds. In my time as a volunteer researcher, I led a research team focused in automating the deployment and operations of [Incus](https://github.com/lxc/incus) in bare metal servers by developing a [Juju charm](https://github.com/cloudlabs-ufscar/incus-charm). Besides that, I've also contributed new features to the Incus project.

### Introduction to Functional Programming (UTFPR) (2021)

I've attended to a [UTFPR](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/) extracurricular course open to the community in which I had the opportunity to met people from different countries and learn a lot about the foundations of **functional programming**.

During this course I've [implemented](https://github.com/luissimas/analytic_tableaux) a method of proving classical logic arguments know as Analytic Tableaux using Elixir, including a simple propositional logic parser using the Erlang libraries leex and yecc.

Besides that, I've [presented a talk](https://youtu.be/rTL4TtpdjIE?t=1573) about the basics of OCaml and the joy of working with algebraic data types and pattern matching on a statically typed language.

### Computer Science bachelor (UFSCar) (2020-2025)

During my computer science bachelor course at UFSCar, I was actively engaged in extracurricular activities such as extension groups. It's also been a great opportunity to dive deeper in computer science fundamental, such as compilers, operating systems and cybersecurity.

### Pragmatic Studio Courses (2023-2024)

I took two great courses on [Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) focusing on Elixir/OTP and Phoenix LiveView. With these courses I was able to fully grasp the core concepts in Elixir and OTP and develop a series of interactive UIs using Phoenix Liveview.

You can check out my certificates of conclusion at my [alumni page](https://pragmaticstudio.com/alumni/lu%C3%ADs-simas-l-sv).

### High School & Technical Certification (IFSP) (2017-2019)

I've attended to a high school that included an integrated technical course on software development. During this period I had the opportunity not only to build solid technical foundations, but also to engage in extracurricular activities, mostly in cultural events.
